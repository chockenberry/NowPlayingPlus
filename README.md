# NowPlayingPlus
 A watchOS app with circular and corner complications for Now Playing controls. Super simple, and super useful.

Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/now-playing-plus/id6443591394?ls=1&mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4G7&ct=GITHUB). If you see PURCHASED greyed out, thatâ€™s [the App Store being dumb](https://support.iconfactory.com/kb/general/reinstall-watchos-app-when-purchased-is-greyed-out).
